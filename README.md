## Missile Detection Using YOLOv11

This project implements a YOLOv11-based object detection model
to detect missile objects in images using a publicly available
dataset from Roboflow Universe.

### Dataset
- Source: Roboflow Universe (Missile Detection Dataset)
- Task: Single-class object detection

### Model
- YOLOv11 (single-stage detector)

### Notes
Portions of the implementation were assisted by ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025).
